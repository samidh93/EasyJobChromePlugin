## **How to Use OpenAI**

### **Step 1: Get an OpenAI API Key**
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to "API Keys" section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key (it starts with `sk-`)

### **Step 2: Configure OpenAI in EasyJob**
1. Open the EasyJob extension popup
2. Go to the "AI Settings" tab
3. Click "Add Settings"
4. Select "OpenAI" as the provider
5. Choose your preferred model:
   - `gpt-4` (most capable, higher cost)
   - `gpt-4-turbo` (good balance of capability and cost)
   - `gpt-4o-mini` (fastest, lowest cost)
   - `gpt-4o` (latest model)
   - `gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective)
6. Enter your OpenAI API key
7. Click "Save Settings"

### **Step 3: Test the Connection**
1. After saving, the extension will automatically test the connection
2. You should see a success message if everything is configured correctly
3. If there's an error, check your API key and internet connection

### **Step 4: Use OpenAI for Job Applications**
1. Navigate to a LinkedIn job application
2. Start the auto-apply process
3. The extension will now use OpenAI to answer questions
4. Monitor the console logs to see OpenAI API calls

## **Supported OpenAI Models**

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `gpt-4` | Most capable model | Complex questions, high accuracy |
| `gpt-4-turbo` | Balanced performance | General use, good cost/performance |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | Fast and efficient | Quick responses, cost-effective |
| `gpt-4o` | Latest model | Best overall performance |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | Cost-effective | Budget-friendly option |

## **Cost Considerations**

### **OpenAI Pricing (as of 2024)**
- **GPT-4**: ~$0.03 per 1K input tokens, ~$0.06 per 1K output tokens
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: ~$0.01 per 1K input tokens, ~$0.03 per 1K output tokens
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: ~$0.0015 per 1K input tokens, ~$0.002 per 1K output tokens
- **GPT-4o**: ~$0.005 per 1K input tokens, ~$0.015 per 1K output tokens
- **GPT-4o-mini**: ~$0.00015 per 1K input tokens, ~$0.0006 per 1K output tokens

### **Typical Job Application Costs**
- **Per question**: ~$0.001-0.01 (depending on model and question length)
- **Per application**: ~$0.01-0.10 (10-20 questions typical)
- **Monthly usage**: ~$1-10 (depending on number of applications)

## **Error Handling**

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

### **Common Errors and Solutions**

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "OpenAI API key is required" | Missing API key | Enter your OpenAI API key |
| "Your OpenAI API key is invalid" | Invalid API key | Check your API key format (should start with `sk-`) |
| "Rate limit exceeded" | Too many requests | Wait a moment and try again |
| "You've exceeded your OpenAI API quota" | Billing issue | Check your OpenAI billing |
| "Network error" | Internet connection | Check your internet connection |

## **Monitoring and Debugging**

### **Console Logs**
Open the browser's Developer Tools (F12) to see detailed logs:

```javascript
// OpenAI API call logs
"Making OpenAI API call: { model: 'gpt-4o-mini', prompt: '...' }"
"OpenAI API call successful: { model: 'gpt-4o-mini', usage: {...} }"

// Error logs
"OpenAI API call failed: { error: 'Invalid API key' }"
```

### **Network Tab**
Check the Network tab in DevTools to see actual API calls to `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`

## **Security Considerations**

### **API Key Storage**
- API keys are stored encrypted in the database
- Keys are only sent to OpenAI's servers
- No keys are logged or stored in plain text

### **Data Privacy**
- Your resume data is sent to OpenAI for processing
- OpenAI may use this data to improve their models
- Consider this when using sensitive information

## **Performance Comparison**

| Provider | Speed | Cost | Quality | Privacy |
|----------|-------|------|---------|---------|
| **Ollama (Local)** | Fast | Free | Good | High |
| **OpenAI** | Fast | Paid | Excellent | Medium |

## **Switching Between Providers**

You can easily switch between Ollama and OpenAI:

1. **To use Ollama**: Select "Ollama (Local)" as provider
2. **To use OpenAI**: Select "OpenAI" as provider and enter API key
3. **Multiple settings**: You can save multiple configurations and switch between them

## **Troubleshooting**

### **OpenAI Not Working**
1. Check your API key is correct
2. Verify you have sufficient credits in your OpenAI account
3. Check your internet connection
4. Look at console logs for specific error messages

### **High Costs**
1. Switch to a cheaper model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)
2. Use Ollama for local processing (free)
3. Monitor your usage in OpenAI dashboard

### **Slow Responses**
1. Try a faster model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)
2. Check your internet connection
3. Consider using Ollama for faster local processing

## **Next Steps**

The implementation is complete and ready to use! You can now:

1. **Test with OpenAI**: Configure OpenAI settings and test on a job application
2. **Compare results**: Try both Ollama and OpenAI to see which works better for you
3. **Monitor costs**: Keep track of your OpenAI usage and costs
4. **Implement other providers**: Use this as a template to add Claude or Gemini support
